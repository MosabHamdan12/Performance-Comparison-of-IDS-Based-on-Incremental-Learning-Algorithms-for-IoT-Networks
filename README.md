This research focuses on enhancing network security within IoT ecosystems through innovative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). It introduces Boruta, an advanced algorithm, to identify the most relevant features for effective threat detection. Furthermore, the study pioneers a unique streaming-based IDS approach specifically designed for IoT networks. This approach integrates three robust algorithms: Hoeffding Adaptive Trees (HAT), Adaptive Random Forest (ARF), and k-Nearest Neighbor with adaptive sliding window detector (KNN-ADWIN). These methodologies are meticulously evaluated using the UNSW-NB15 network dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The aim is to bolster IoT network security, ensuring resilience against evolving cyber threats.
